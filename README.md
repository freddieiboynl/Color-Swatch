Now you *never* have to create color swatches in a design tool *ever* again! Install this package, tap on the `color` prop to open the color picker, and watch as you get color information automagically âœ¨

Bonus: In Preview mode, you can tap on each value to copy it to your clipboard so you can paste it anywhere. Just for you.
